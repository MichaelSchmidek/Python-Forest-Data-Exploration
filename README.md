# Forest-Data-Exploration

**Motivation**

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple overview of how Python data visualization tools can be used to understand a complex, large dataset. 

The dataset in question contains information about features of forested areas. The data includes numerical variables (distance to XXX feature) as well as categorical variables (soil type, tree cover type).

Through 7 data visualization tenchniques, we will drive understanding of this data and the trends that underlie it.
